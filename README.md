A mobile web application that streamlines the process for volunteers that deliver meals from foodbanks to homebound individuals, providing orted list of recipients from any chosen foodbank. The application will given pickup and delivery instructions. Once Packages are picked up from food bank location the app will provide a list of all the dropoff locations of the recipients. The directions provided will be an optimal route to ensure the volunteer drives either the least amount of time or miles.

## Project Backstory

This was a 2 week long project built during my fourth module at Brainstation Web Development Bootcamp. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to find community gardens, get involved and plant and log fruit trees that were planted to create a crowdsourced database. After initial research I found a greater need to start with providing an application that would make a more streamlined process for volunteers that deliver meals from foodbanks to homebound individuals, and greatly increase the amount of individuals that may be reached. The design and initail layout was created in Figma, and I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-5.3`.

## Project Status

TO-DO items include
Build the Backend
OAuth and user signup
Create a way to have the map provide directions within the apps map
Give user option between least amount of miles or driving duration for deliveries
Give user the option to change the order of deliveries
Ensure each delivery was dropped off
Once delivery was confirmed add delivery count to the recipient for the week.
Add tests using Cypress

#### Stage of Progress:

This project is currently in development.

## Reflection

- It was an incredible experience having the opportunity to work on a project that I am so passionate about and to provide
  a solution that may have major impacts.
- The build captured more than I initially planned on and it was fun dreaming and designing as I continued to push for a more completed solution.
- Working with Google Maps api's within the react context was an interesting and new experience.
- Creating the algorithm for users distance was fun to work with and provided a challenge to ensure that I was providing optimal routes.
  Another challenge was creating a way to have the map provide directions within the apps map
- The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router-Dom 5.3, React-Google-Maps, Sass, JSX, Figma, and Github.
